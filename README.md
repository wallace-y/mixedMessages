# Prompt Generator

This project is an HTML webpage that generates a random text prompt for DALL-E, an AI image generation model by OpenAI, and shows an image gallery of previously generated images. The code uses the Bootstrap framework for styling and responsiveness.

There is a "Generate" button that calls a JavaScript function to generate the random prompt, and a prompt output box to display the generated prompt.

The image gallery section displays generated images in a card layout using Bootstrap's grid system. Each card contains an image and a title of the generated image.
